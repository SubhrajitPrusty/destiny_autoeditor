## How it works?

- Given a video, it searches for your IGN in the kill feed on the bottom left of the screen
- Only works for 1920x1080 for now - maybe works for other resolutions IDK
- Works best with tritanopia (colour blindness) setting.
- Currently clips everytime name is found - which is obviously  not ideal
- No audio yet.
